**⛔️ DEPRECATED: This repo is no longer supported, please consider using** https://github.com/vmware/ansible-collection-alb **instead since**
 **this role is migrated to ansible collections.**

Using this module you are able to install the Avi Vantage Controlller, to your system. However, minimum requirements must be met.

> **Warning:**  
> This Ansible role is not meant to be ran repeatedly on the host. It's meant for deployment only. Once deployed the configuration for Avi is managed by Avi.

## Requirements

A Cisco CSP Device

### CSP Deployment Example

> **Note:**  
> When running. `gather_facts` needs to be set to `false`, failure to do so will cause Ansible failure on first step.
